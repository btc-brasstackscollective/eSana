					<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
					<h4>eSana&reg; PROGRAMS ARE NOT INSURANCE!</h4>
					
					<p>The discount medical plans of eSana&reg; offer a reduction in the cost of medical, dental, vision, pharmaceutical and chiropractic services. eSana&reg; discount benefit programs are not insurance, nor are they an alternative to or substitution for insurance coverage.

					<p>The range of discounts for medical or ancillary services provided under this plan will vary depending on the type of provider and medical or ancillary service received.</p>
					
					<p>PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING STATES WHERE eSana&reg; DOES NOT OFFER SERVICES:</p>
					<p>Alaska, Guam, Montana, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wyoming, US Virgin Islands, Utah</p>
